Forward is the protocol used by Fluentd to route message between peers.

- Protocol specification: [Forward protocol specification v1](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/wiki/Forward-Protocol-Specification-v1)
- Library used [IBM/fluent-forward-go](https://github.com/IBM/fluent-forward-go) (MIT License)

## Getting Started

### Settings

| Property | Default value | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| endpoint |  | string | **MANDATORY** Target URL to send `Forward` log streams to |
| connection_timeout | 30s | time.Duration | Maximum amount of time a dial will wait for a connect to complete |
| tls.insecure | true | bool | If set to **true**, the connexion is not secured with TLS. |
| tls.insecure_skip_verify | false | bool | Controls whether the exporter verifies the server's certificate chain and host name. If **true**, any certificate is accepted and any host name. This mode is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks |
| tls.ca_file | "" | string | Used for mTLS. Path to the CA cert. For a client this verifies the server certificate |
| tls.cert_file | "" | string | Used for mTLS. Path to the client TLS cert to use |
| tls.key_file | "" | string | Used for mTLS. Path to the client TLS key to use |
| shared_key | "" | string | A key string known by the server, used for authorization |
| require_ack| false | bool | Protocol delivery acknowledgment for log streams : true = at-least-once, false = at-most-once |
| tag | "tag" | string | Fluentd tag is a string separated by '.'s (e.g. myapp.access), and is used as the directions for Fluentd's internal routing engine |
| compress_gzip | false | bool | Transparent data compression. You can use this feature to reduce the transferred payload size |
| default_labels_enabled | true | map[string]bool | If omitted then default labels will be added. If one of the labels is omitted then this label will be added |

See the default values in the method `createDefaultConfig()` in [factory.go](factory.go) file.

Example, for `default_labels_enabled` that will add only the `time` attribute in the log record:

```yaml
exporters:
  fluentforward:
    endpoint: a.new.fluentforward.target:24224
    connection_timeout: 10s
    require_ack: true
    tag: nginx
    compress_gzip: true
    default_labels_enabled:
      time: true
      exporter: false
      job: false
      instance: false
```

Example with TLS enabled and shared key:

```yaml
exporters:
  fluentforward:
    endpoint: a.new.fluentforward.target:24224
    connection_timeout: 10s
    tls:
      insecure: false
    shared_key: otelcol-dev
```

Example with mutual TLS authentication (mTLS):

```yaml
exporters:
  fluentforward:
    endpoint: a.new.fluentforward.target:24224
    connection_timeout: 10s
    tls:
      insecure: false
      ca_file: ca.crt.pem
      cert_file: client.crt.pem
      key_file: client.key.pem
```

## Severity

OpenTelemetry uses `record.severity` to track log levels.

## Advanced Configuration

Queued retry capabilities are enabled by default, see the [Exporter Helper queuing and retry settings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/exporter/exporterhelper/README.md) to fine tune them.

Example usage:

```yaml
exporters:
  fluentforward:
    endpoint: a.new.fluentforward.target:24224
    connection_timeout: 10s
    retry_on_failure:
      enabled: true
      initial_interval: 5s
      max_interval: 30s
      max_elapsed_time: 5m
    sending_queue:
      enabled: true
      num_consumers: 10
      queue_size: 2000
```
